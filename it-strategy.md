### Gregor Hophe - Buy vs. Build Revisited (article series)
Insightful article series about how to think about buy vs build and how to implement it. 
Part 1. includes a couple of non intuitive examples which helped me to better reason about the Buy vs. Build decisions. Part 2 gives a couple of heuristics on how to decide between buying and building. Part 3 gives advise on where to start build if you decide to build. Part 4 puts buy vs build into a cloud context.
